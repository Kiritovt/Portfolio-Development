# 💻 Development Portfolio

Welcome to my **Development Portfolio** — a collection of all the projects, exercises, and experiments I create while learning different programming languages and technologies.

This repository documents my progress as a developer, from foundational logic and algorithms to more advanced web and software development.

## 🧭 Purpose

This repo serves as a **central hub** for:
- Tracking my learning journey across multiple programming languages  
- Building practical skills through small projects and exercises  
- Showcasing my evolution as a developer to future employers or collaborators  




💡 *Each folder corresponds to a language or technology stack. Inside each section you’ll find exercises, notes, and small or medium-sized projects.*


## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, Java, C, C++ (coming soon)
- **Frameworks:** Flask, React, Spring Boot
- **Databases:** MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB
- **Tools:** Git, Visual Studio Code
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub for collaboration and tracking changes


## 🚀 Goals

- Develop clean, maintainable, and modular code  
- Learn full-stack development fundamentals  
- Build a foundation for backend and network programming  
- Integrate coding with networking & cybersecurity knowledge  


## 🧩 Future Additions

- REST API mini-projects  
- Automation scripts (Python & Bash)  
- Web security exercises  
- Algorithm challenges
